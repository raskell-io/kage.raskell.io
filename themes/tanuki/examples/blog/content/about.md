# About Me

Hey there! I'm a software developer passionate about building things for the web. I spend most of my time writing code, learning new technologies, and occasionally writing about what I've learned.

## What I Do

By day, I work on web applications—everything from frontend interfaces to backend APIs. I particularly enjoy:

- **Frontend Development**: React, Vue, and modern CSS
- **Backend Systems**: Node.js, Rust, and databases
- **Developer Experience**: Tooling, automation, and workflows
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and maintaining projects

## This Site

This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and the Tanuki theme. It's where I share articles about web development, design patterns, and lessons learned along the way.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/example/blog) if you're curious about how it's built.
